Algorithm For Game :

Start :

		M <- No. of kids 
		N <- Random No.(M>N)


		Get the detail of M students in Circular Linked-List
		
		var Temp , Winner
		Temp <- 1st Kid

		while(M>0)
		{
	
			i <- N;

			while(i>0)
			{

				temp.next
				i--
			}
		
			Delete node before temp
			
			M--
		}

		Print Winner <- temp
